<body><h2>Who am I?</h2></body>
<hr>
<p>My name is Ray, and I am new to the coding/ scripting fields of things. I came into this program with
    little knowledge and only knew how to code in C# so I was nervous coming into this program. I have some hobbies
    that I do on my off days of school, such as gaming or building gunplas. Some games that I have played are chess, block blast, and 
    clash royale and some people may wonder what gunplas are, so I will give a brief overview of what it is. 
    Gunplas are robot figurines that you build with some nippers, hobby knives and sandpaper.

<body><h2>How I ended up in the CIT program</h2></body>
<hr>
<p>I was lost as to which post secondary school I should go to and what career I wanted to take, and so I went on
    and applied to two different schools, one was BCIT, the other was KPU. For KPU, I applied for their marketing
    management program and did the same with BCIT at first, until I thought about it for a bit longer. I did not
    want to advertise things because I never enjoyed that, so I looked into the BCIT CST program, but unfortunetly I did
    not take pre-calculus and instead took foundations. After a long back and forth conversation with the BCIT admissions team,
    I came to the conclusion that I should just take CIT. It was a big risk though, because I only had a week to give
    my tuition in, but still managed to hand it in on the last day before they went on break. I did have something else that I wanted to do though
    , I wanted to enter the carpentry program that BCIT had, but thought to myself and wondered if the tools would be expensive. So, after
    a long decision, I still thought this would be better for me.
